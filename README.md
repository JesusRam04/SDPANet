# SDPANet
This repository provides the code for the paper "Improved Sales Time Series Predictions Using Deep Neural Networks with a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Adjustment Mechanism"
# Usage
We provide processed Cainiao dataset that you can use to slice data as needed.
We give the examples to run Cainiao CW1 in python main.py.
# Environment
Python 3.6.7 and Pytorch 1.8.0

# Acknowledgements
This multivariate time series forecasting framework was implemented based on the following two repositories:

* [MLCNN](https://github.com/smallGum/MLCNN-Multivariate-Time-Series)
* [DARNN](https://github.com/fanyun-sun/DARNN)

Some codes and design patterns are borrowed from these two excellent frameworks.
